## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

EpiGimp follows modern C++ best practices with a clean, modular architecture:

### Core Components
- **Application**: Main orchestrator managing all components (split into Core, Loop, and Events modules)
- **Canvas**: Image display and manipulation area with RAII resource management (split into Core, ImageOps, Input, and Drawing modules)
- **Toolbar**: UI toolbar with extensible button system and integrated color palette (split into Core, Colors, and Buttons modules)
- **ColorPalette**: Interactive color selection component with 16 predefined colors
- **FileBrowser**: Safe in-application file navigation (split into Core, Navigation, and Dialogs modules)
- **Command System**: Complete undo/redo history management with command pattern implementation
- **HistoryManager**: Manages undo/redo operations with 50-level history stack

### Modular Architecture Benefits
- **Maintainable**: Each file focuses on a specific aspect of functionality (<200 lines each)
- **Readable**: Clear separation between initialization, rendering, input handling, and business logic  
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features without modifying unrelated code
- **Debuggable**: Issues can be quickly isolated to specific functional areas

### Key Design Patterns
- **RAII**: Automatic resource cleanup for textures and images
- **Event System**: Type-safe event handling for component communication
- **Interface-Based Design**: Abstract interfaces for testability and modularity
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Build and run
make && ./EpiGimp

# Test basic functionality
./EpiGimp png/test.png

# Complete feature testing workflow:
# 1. Load Image: Click "Load Image", navigate and select a file
# 2. Drawing: Click "Crayon", draw multiple strokes on the image
# 3. Undo/Redo: Test Ctrl+Z (undo) and Ctrl+Y (redo) operations
# 4. Save Image: Click "Save Image", choose location and filename
# 5. Verify: Drawings and undo/redo states work correctly
# 6. Format conversion: Load PNG, save as JPG to test conversion
# 7. Edge cases: Try saving without extension (should auto-add .png)
# 8. History testing: Draw 5+ strokes, undo all, then redo all
```

### Quality Assurance Verified
- ✅ **No crashes** from missing file extensions
- ✅ **Image orientation** preserved correctly when saving
- ✅ **Drawing persistence** - strokes saved permanently with images
- ✅ **Cancel buttons** work in both open and save dialogs
- ✅ **Text input** - Single character deletion with backspace

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Tests on Ubuntu with both GCC and Clang support
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically builds Raylib from source for consistent testing
- **Headless Testing**: Uses `xvfb` virtual display for GUI-dependent tests
- **Test Results**: **48/49 tests passing** (excludes GUI initialization in headless environment)

**Workflow Process**:
1. **Environment Setup**: Ubuntu latest with build tools and OpenGL dependencies
2. **Raylib Installation**: Builds Raylib 5.6 from source with shared libraries
3. **Project Build**: CMake configuration and parallel compilation
4. **Test Execution**: Runs comprehensive test suite with virtual display
5. **Result Reporting**: Provides immediate pass/fail feedback on GitHub

**CI Status**: 
- ✅ **Build Status**: Passing
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 48/49 tests (98% success rate in CI environment)
- ✅ **Dependency Management**: Automated Raylib compilation
- ✅ **Quality Gate**: Prevents broken code from merging

**Local vs CI Testing**:
- **Local**: All 46 tests pass with full GUI support
- **CI**: 48 tests pass (skips `RaylibInitialization` due to headless environment)
- **Coverage**: Core functionality fully validated in both environments

### 📝 Contribution Guidelines

#### Code Style
- **Language**: Modern C++17 features encouraged
- **Formatting**: Follow existing code style (4 spaces, no tabs)
- **File Size**: Keep source files under 200 lines for maintainability
- **Naming**: 
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `FileBrowser`)
  - Functions/Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `loadImage`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
